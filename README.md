# Floraverse VN viewer

**About**
This is a standalone viewer for the Visual Novels posted to floraverse.com , made by Glip and [Eevee](https://github.com/eevee) for the webcomic Floraverse, such as Itchy Itchy and Try Try Again. This is an experiment to see if I can do it. I did not paint any of the pretty pictures.
Basically, a standalone version of [this](http://apps.veekun.com/flora-cutscenes/)
I have no affiliation with Floraverse, but Eevee said it would be "interesting" if I could wrap it with Electron.
This is based off my fork of the Electron official example project.

## A note
All the coffeescript (literally all of it) is written by Eevee, and almost all of the files inside the /assets folder are made by either her or her partner Glip for the webcomic [Floraverse](floraverse.com).
