This does not lend itself to a society of strict expectations and requirements.\n\nWhen they are not sleeping, they are most often daydreaming, or thinking about their next sleep session. Interpersonal relationships are very slow to start, if they happen at all.\n\nThis is not to suggest that bearrings are distant or cold. They are accepting and friendly, but find difficulty investing themselves in others or situations which require large amounts of waking attention."

This is usually only possible when the bearring is asleep, although intense periods of daydreaming can trigger it.\n\nUnlike nearly all forms of astral projection, bearrings are able to influence the physical world with theirs, and are even able to be observed by some individuals. What allows an individual to see a bearring's astral form is currently unknown, but if that individual can see one astral form, they can see them all.\n\nBearrings take great delight in exploring places on Owel while dreaming that would otherwise be too dangerous to explore otherwise. Places like Deep Mountain, Dendain, Peril, Neck-Deep Mire, and Sere Valley can all be investigated without any supplies or protective gear.\n\nBearrings are able to remember their dream-explorations with greater clarity than most individuals, but they may struggle with fine details. If their astral form is destroyed or removed for any reason other than being woken up, it will be very difficult for them to remember anything about the dream.\n\nTheir astral form originates from their place of sleep, although a few experienced bearrings are able to start at locations that have been marked by their astral form, essentially acting as a checkpoint. Exactly how this happens is not fully known."
