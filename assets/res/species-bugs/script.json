They have suppressed their once-constant prey drive, and only hunt when hunger dictates.\n\nFuzzy Moths live in large communities, and build shelters out of leaves, moss, mud and rocks. Their territories are always enclosed by large wooden barricades, presumably to ward off larger predators.\n\nFuzzy Moths are not inherently hostile to outsiders, but lack any kind of experience with them. Their greeting consists of striking each other’s leaf-like whips with great force. Fuzzy Moths do not seem to realize that most outsiders are incapable of participating in this. Were it not for her suit, Lily would have sustained several grievous head injuries during her visit.\n\nFuzzy Moths have tamed and domesticated a variety of insect I have named “Sawhorses”.
